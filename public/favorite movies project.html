<h3>3.The Unforgivable</h3>
<p>This film follows Sandra Bullock, starring as Ruth Slater, a woman who has just been released from prison after serving a 20 year sentence for murder. The film unfolds in a way that leaves the viewer obsessively trying to fit the puzzle pieces of Ruth's past together. The film follows her effort to rejoin society and to recconect with an estranged sister. This film has an incredible twist that you won't see coming.</p>

<p>The first time I saw this film, it was during a super low point in my life. I woke up early one morning and had time to kill before work. I put this on and was able to completely forget my sorrows for the nearly two hours that I entangled myself into the web of this jaw-dropping thriller. It definitely gets bonus points for that.</p>

<p>I can't leave out the props it gets for starring Sandra Bullock as well. There are two types of people in the world - Sandra Bullock fans and people with no taste.</p>

<h3>0.000015. Sorry to Bother You</h3>

<p>Lakieth Stanfield leads in this film as Cassius "Cash" Green, an average, down-on-his-luck American just trying to get by. This surrealiest comedey turned horror film is a scathing critique of the American capitalist system. It explores the idea of dystopian horrors in our current society. The film is about the struggle of grind culture in the United States, the inability of younger generations to own property or often even to just rent a place that is honestly habitable, the commodification of Black people in the workplace and racism in the workplace, and much more. It imagines a reality in which companies like Amazon have turned to creating Company towns and running baleful experiments on their workers, with an excessive focus on experimenting on Black employees. This film will absolutely leave you thinking, seething, and feeling sick.</p>

<p>Also, killer cast selection, especially leading with Lakieth Stanfield. He is absolutely an upcoming star, and everything he's been doing recently has been gold.</p>

<h3>97. The Irishman</h3>
<p>Biopics are my favorite types of movies. I love seeing how stories about real life end up getting told in the dramatic form. Martin Scorsese, per usual, fuckin delivered with this film. Killer casting with Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, and Joe Pecsi. Not only are these men impeccable at delivering mob performances, but they also have undeniable charisma in their work together. This film just flows.</p>

<p>As for the coverage of the story, the death of Jimmmy Hoffa will eternally remain a mystery, but I believe fully that this film presents the most likely explanation for his death. The film is based off a book written alongside Frank "The Irishman" Sheeran, longtime friend, confidant, and alleged murder of Jimmy Hoffa. He explains everything that led up to him receiving the orders to take Hoffa out and exactly how the abduction and murder allegedly went down. He told this story to a reporter at the end of his life as a means to clear his conscience for his sins, which leads me to believe he was telling the truth. He had no incentive to lie about killing a loved one in his past at the end of his life.</p>
    
<p>I've read the book, and Scorsese recreates the stories told in exacting detail. This is exactly what I always want from a biopic - a research basis on first hand accounts of the situation, and an exact retelling of the story to the highest extent possible, with no dramatic deviations or changes to the story. It was a dope experience to get to see the situations play out before me, just as they likely went down. </p>
